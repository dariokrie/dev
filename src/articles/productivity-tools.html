            <h1>Productivity Tools</h1>
            <h3>Which I use daily</h3>
            <p class="article-date">Published on November 11, 2023 by Dario Krieger</p>
            <p>
                More than a year has passed since I started my apprenticeship as an application developer. In the first few months of
                the apprenticeship, I noticed, that using tools to help boost productivity is necessary - not only for developing
                but also for school and private projects.
            </p>
            <h2>Professional Development Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Each development team in the company I currently work for uses the same tools.
                Not only does that help switching development teams but also helps maintain consistency in the development process.
                Repositories, Sprintboards, Backlogs, Deployment and so on are all managed on Azure DevOps.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've started developing with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code at first. In October 2023, I discovered IntelliJ Rider which now acts
                as my main IDE for developing backend and frontend projects.
                The reason for the switch to Rider is simple: I don't have to switch IDEs for developing backend or frontend, I can simply stay in Rider and do both at once -
                just without needing to switch my development environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I've started with GitHub Projects and Repositories linked to each other. For the first few projects, it worked. With few projects done, I've noticed, that GitHub Projects is not
                enough for tracking multiple projects at once and keeping track of the effort used for each task.
            </p>
            <p>
                I discovered Atlassian Jira as an upgrade to GitHub Projects. Not only does Jira help track projects and so on, but also helps with agile strategies.
                I use a minimalist version of Scrum for personal projects, so I still have sprints. As I'm working alone on personal projects, there's no need for daily standup
                meetings, retrospectives, backlog refinements and so on. The only thing I do, are sprint reviews, to see how I've performed in personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my personal projects are versioned by Git. All repositories are stored on GitHub, but not on my personal account. I've opened a second GitHub account which
                is an organisation. In conclusion, I own an organisation named EVLGT, where I publish my projects - so it's like my own business.
            </p>
            <h2>School and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Since I started my apprenticeship, which is obviously connected with obligatory school days each week, was clear, that  I needed tools which help me create an overview
                of my homework and exam preparation sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started off by creating appointments in my calendar for each homework and exam preparation session. This just did not work, as I've never done the tasks then when the
                appointment in my calendar was. So I searched for a solution and stumbled across Notion.
                I've set up a private Notion which just had a "Student Dashboard" which just works like a sprintboard or similar. I've also stopped making appointments in my calendar,
                as I now enter each task in my Notion. I've started creating "Learning Focus Blocks" in my calendar which just advise me, to complete my Notion tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In my opinion, it extremely helps to use productivity tools daily. Using these tools helps me focus on the important task and not any not needed organizing tasks or similar.
